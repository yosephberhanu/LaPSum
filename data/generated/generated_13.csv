13,32,"How are these types or objects related (e.g., whole-part relationships)?",wg/scrypt,"

Based on the names of these classes, I can identify several potential relationships:

1. Library Loading System:
   - LibraryLoader appears to be an interface or base class
   - JarLibraryLoader, NilLibraryLoader, and SysLibraryLoader seem to be implementations of LibraryLoader
   - LibraryLoaders likely provides factory methods or utilities for working with these loaders

2. Cryptographic Components:
   - SCrypt, PBKDF, and Base64 appear to be cryptographic utilities
   - SCryptUtil likely provides helper methods for working with SCrypt

3. Platform Detection:
   - Platform likely represents platform information
   - UnsupportedPlatformException is thrown when an unsupported platform is detected

4. Testing Framework:
   - Classes ending with ""Test"" (JarLibraryLoaderTest, LibraryLoadersTest, PBKDFTest, PlatformTest, SCryptTest, SCryptUtilTest) are test classes for their respective components
   - AbstractPlatformDetectionTest is likely a base class for platform-related tests
   - CryptoTestUtil probably provides testing utilities for cryptographic classes
