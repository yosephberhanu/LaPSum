7,1,Is there an entity named something like JarLibraryLoaderTest in the wg/scrypt?,wg/scrypt,"

Based on the information provided, I cannot determine if there is an entity named JarLibraryLoaderTest or something similar in the wg/scrypt codebase. The response contains only numerical values without any context about entity names. I don't have enough specific information to answer your question about the existence of a JarLibraryLoaderTest entity."
7,2,Is there an entity named something like package com.lambdaworks.codec in the wg/scrypt?,wg/scrypt,"

Based on the information provided, there is no indication of an entity named ""package com.lambdaworks.codec"" or anything similar in the wg/scrypt repository. The search only returned the four classes listed above, which do not match or resemble the name you're looking for."
7,3,Is there an entity named something like detectArch in the wg/scrypt?,wg/scrypt,"

Based on the limited information provided, I can confirm that there is a method or entity that matches or is similar to ""detectArch"" in the wg/scrypt codebase. However, I don't have specific details about what this method does, its parameters, return values, or where exactly it's located in the codebase. For more detailed information about this method, you would need to examine the specific file where it's defined or look at its usage within the codebase."
7,4,Is there an entity named something like Base64 in the package com.lambdaworks.jni.test?,wg/scrypt,Error: cound not answer
7,5,Is there an entity named something like scrypt_paper_appendix_b in the package com.lambdaworks.codec?,wg/scrypt,"

There doesn't appear to be an entity named ""scrypt_paper_appendix_b"" or anything similar in the com.lambdaworks.codec package. The only entity found in this package is Base64. If you're looking for something related to scrypt implementation, it might be located in a different package or might not exist in the codebase being examined."
7,6,Is there an entity named something like check in the LibraryLoaders?,wg/scrypt,Error: cound not answer
7,7,What are the parts of this wg/scrypt?,wg/scrypt,"

I don't have enough information to provide a complete answer about the parts of wg/scrypt. The response only indicates that one class or entity was found, but doesn't provide any details about what that entity is or what components make up wg/scrypt. To properly answer your question, I would need more specific information about the structure, components, and functionality of wg/scrypt."
7,8,What are the parts of this package com.lambdaworks.jni?,wg/scrypt,"

Based on the naming, this package appears to be related to Java Native Interface (JNI) functionality, with components for loading native libraries across different platforms, detecting platform information, and handling platform-specific operations. The package includes both implementation classes and their corresponding test classes."
7,9,What are the parts of this LibraryLoaders?,wg/scrypt,"

However, I don't have enough information to properly explain what the parts of LibraryLoaders are. The response only contains a list of numbers without any context about what these numbers represent or how they relate to LibraryLoaders. To provide a meaningful answer about the components or structure of LibraryLoaders, I would need more specific information about its implementation, classes, methods, or functionality."

7,13,When was this package com.lambdaworks.jni.test last modified?,wg/scrypt,Error: cound not answer
7,14,When was this PBKDF last modified?,wg/scrypt,"

I don't have enough information to determine when the PBKDF class was last modified. While I can see that the PBKDF class exists in the codebase along with a PBKDFTest class, I don't have access to the modification history or timestamps for these files. The git command that tried to retrieve this information encountered an error."
7,15,What does this wg/scrypt do?,wg/scrypt,[]
7,16,What was done in the most recent modification to this wg/scrypt?,wg/scrypt,Error: cound not answer
7,17,What was done in the most recent modification to this package com.lambdaworks.crypto.test?,wg/scrypt,"

I don't have enough information to answer the question about the most recent modification to the com.lambdaworks.crypto.test package. While I can see that the package exists and contains test files (CryptoTestUtil.java, PBKDFTest.java, SCryptTest.java, and SCryptUtilTest.java), I don't have access to git commit history or modification timestamps that would show what changes were made most recently."
7,18,What was done in the most recent modification to this SCryptTest?,wg/scrypt,"

Without more specific information about the most recent modification to SCryptTest, I cannot provide details about what changes were made. There is no git history or commit information provided that would show the most recent modifications to this class. To answer this question accurately, I would need information about the commit history, pull requests, or specific code changes related to SCryptTest."
7,1,Is there an entity named something like FloatArrayPutAtMetaMethod in the groovy/groovy-core?,groovy/groovy-core,"

Yes, there is an entity named exactly ""FloatArrayPutAtMetaMethod"" in the groovy/groovy-core repository. This appears to be a meta-method related to putting values at specified positions in float arrays in Groovy."
7,2,Is there an entity named something like package org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.wrappers in the groovy/groovy-core?,groovy/groovy-core,"

Based on this information, yes, there appears to be a package structure in groovy/groovy-core that contains various wrapper classes. While the exact package name ""org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.wrappers"" wasn't explicitly confirmed, the presence of these wrapper classes (BooleanWrapper, ByteWrapper, etc.) strongly suggests that this package or something very similar to it exists in the groovy-core codebase."
7,3,Is there an entity named something like isTraitSelf in the groovy/groovy-core?,groovy/groovy-core,"

Based on the limited information provided, it appears there is a method that might be related to what you're looking for, but the specific details about ""isTraitSelf"" are incomplete. I don't have enough information to confirm whether there is exactly an entity named ""isTraitSelf"" in the groovy/groovy-core codebase or to provide details about its implementation or usage. More specific information would be needed to give you a complete answer about this entity."

The package org.codehaus.groovy.syntax appears to contain classes related to syntax parsing, token handling, and exception management for the Groovy programming language. It includes various exception types (like ParserException, ReadException, SyntaxException, TokenException), token-related classes (Token, TokenTest), and utility classes for handling abstract syntax trees (ASTHelper), concrete syntax trees (CSTNode), numbers, and types."
7,9,What are the parts of this GenStubsAdapter?,groovy/groovy-core,"

Unfortunately, this information is insufficient to describe the parts of a GenStubsAdapter. The response only contains two numbers without any context about what they represent or how they relate to the GenStubsAdapter. To properly answer your question about the components or structure of the GenStubsAdapter, I would need more detailed information about its implementation, methods, properties, or structure."
